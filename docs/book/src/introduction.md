# Introduction

**Awaken** is a modular AI agent runtime framework built in Rust. It provides phase-based execution with snapshot isolation and deterministic replay, a typed state engine with key scoping (`thread` / `run`) and merge strategies (`exclusive` / `commutative`), a plugin lifecycle system for extensibility, and a multi-protocol server surface supporting AI SDK v6, AG-UI, A2A, and MCP over HTTP and stdio, plus ACP over stdio.

## Crate Overview

| Crate | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `awaken-contract` | Core contracts: types, traits, state model, agent specs |
| `awaken-runtime` | Execution engine: phase loop, plugin system, agent loop, builder |
| `awaken-server` | HTTP/SSE gateway with protocol adapters |
| `awaken-stores` | Storage backends: memory, file, postgres |
| `awaken-tool-pattern` | Glob/regex tool matching for permission and reminder rules |
| `awaken-ext-permission` | Permission plugin with allow/deny/ask policies |
| `awaken-ext-observability` | OpenTelemetry-based LLM and tool call tracing |
| `awaken-ext-mcp` | Model Context Protocol client integration |
| `awaken-ext-skills` | Skill package discovery and activation |
| `awaken-ext-reminder` | Declarative reminder rules triggered after tool execution |
| `awaken-ext-generative-ui` | Declarative UI components (A2UI protocol) |
| `awaken-ext-deferred-tools` | Deferred tool loading with probabilistic promotion |
| `awaken` | Facade crate that re-exports core modules |

## Architecture

```text
Application code
  registers tools / models / providers / plugins / agent specs
        |
        v
AgentRuntime
  resolves AgentSpec -> ResolvedAgent
  builds ExecutionEnv from plugins
  runs the phase loop and exposes cancel / decision control
        |
        v
Server + storage surfaces
  HTTP routes, SSE replay, mailbox, protocol adapters, thread/run persistence
```

## Core Principle

All state access follows snapshot isolation. Phase hooks see an immutable snapshot; mutations are collected in a MutationBatch and applied atomically after convergence.

## What's in This Book

- **Tutorials** — Learn by building a first agent and first tool
- **How-to** — Task-focused implementation guides for integration and operations
- **Reference** — API, protocol, config, and schema lookup pages
- **Explanation** — Architecture and design rationale

## Recommended Reading Path

If you are new to the repository, use this order:

1. Read [First Agent](./tutorials/first-agent.md) to see the smallest runnable flow.
2. Read [First Tool](./tutorials/first-tool.md) to understand state reads and writes.
3. Read [Tool Trait](./reference/tool-trait.md) before writing production tools.
4. Use [Build an Agent](./how-to/build-an-agent.md) and [Add a Tool](./how-to/add-a-tool.md) as implementation checklists.
5. Return to [Architecture](./explanation/architecture.md) and [Run Lifecycle and Phases](./explanation/run-lifecycle-and-phases.md) when you need the full execution model.
